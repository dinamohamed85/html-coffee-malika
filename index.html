        <strong>Turkish coffee</strong> is very finely ground coffee brewed by boiling. Any coffee bean may be used;
        arabica
        varieties
        are
        considered best, but robusta or a blend is also used. The coffee grounds are left in the coffee when served.
        The coffee may be ground at home in a manual grinder made for the very fine grind, ground to order by coffee
        merchants
        in most parts of the world, or bought ready-ground from many shops.

        <strong>Home roasting</strong> is the process of roasting coffee from green coffee beans on a small scale for
        personal
        consumption. Home
        roasting of coffee has been practiced for centuries, using simple methods such as roasting in cast iron skillets
        over a
        wood fire and hand-turning small steel drums on a kitchen stovetop.
        Until the early 20th century, it was more common to roast coffee at home than to buy pre-roasted coffee.
        Following World
        War I, commercial coffee roasting became prevalent and, combined with the distribution of instant coffee, home
        roasting
        decreased substantially.

    <h3>French Roast</h3>

    <p style="width:70%">
        <strong>French</strong> (alt. Turkish, Dark, Espresso) is the name applied to a degree of roast of coffee beans
        resulting in a
        dark brown
        coffee bean. In this roast, the beans are well into the second crack. French roasted beans will have a dark
        brown color
        and a shiney surface from its oils. Coffee brewed from French roasted beans will have the natural characteristic
        flavors
        of the bean muted, particularly any acidic notes. Bittersweet tones from the roast will dominate the flavor.
        French
        roast coffees are prevalent in coffee associated with the American West. This roast profile is also commonly
        used in
        American espresso.

        <strong>Coffee production in Colombia</strong> has a reputation for producing mild, well-balanced coffee
        beans.Colombia's
        average annual coffee production of 11.5 million bags is the third total highest in the world, after Brazil and
        Vietnam,
        though highest in terms of the arabica bean.The beans are exported to United States, Germany, France,
        Japan, and Italy.Most coffee is grown in the Colombian coffee growing axis region, while other regions focus on
        quality instead of volumes, such as Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. In 2007, the European Union granted Colombian
        coffee a
        protected designation of origin status. In 2011, UNESCO declared the "Coffee Cultural Landscape" of Colombia, a
        World Heritage site.
